{"name":"Statstat","tagline":"Analysis of stats from your thermostat","body":"# Stat stat\r\nA set of tools to record and analyze data from a smart thermostat.\r\n\r\n##Thermostat support\r\nCurrently, only Honeywell Thermostats controllable through their Total Connect system are supported. Additional thermostats can be added as plugins using the plugin structure outlined here- https://github.com/jamesnw/statstat/wiki/Plugin-structure\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n* Add your database info to globals.php.example. Rename to globals.php\r\n* Add your Honeywell Total Connect info to logininfo.php.example. (The device_number is the number that appears in the URL at https://mytotalconnectcomfort.com/portal/NUMBERHERE/Zones). Rename to logininfo.php\r\n* Run dbsetup.php\r\n* Add a cron job to run cron.php every 5 minutes. Example line in cron- `*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/php5 /full/path/to/stat/cron.php`\r\n* Wait for useful data to come in\r\n\r\n##Analysis\r\n###Graph\r\nSee your temperatures fluctuate and change.\r\n![](http://jamesnw.github.io/statstat/images/graph.png)\r\n\r\n###Delay\r\nSee how long it takes for your house to heat and cool based on outside temperature\r\n![](http://jamesnw.github.io/statstat/images/delay.png)\r\n\r\n##Security & Privacy\r\nAs this does not allow anyone (including you) to control your thermostat via the web interface, security concerns are minimal. However, you do need to store your password in plain text on the server, so anyone with access to that would have access to control your thermostat.\r\n\r\nFor privacy- if you have privacy concerns, I'd suggest using htpasswd to put the info behind a password.\r\n","google":"UA-39292199-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
